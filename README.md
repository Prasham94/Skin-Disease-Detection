**Skin Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks**
**Introduction**
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify different types of skin diseases from images. The model is trained to recognize and categorize images into one of 14 skin disease categories. With proper training and optimization, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 93%, demonstrating its effectiveness in skin disease detection.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of images of skin diseases, each labeled with one of the 14 disease types. The images are preprocessed and resized to 128x128 pixels to standardize the input for the CNN model.
